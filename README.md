The mip bot is a small project I decided to create while learning javascript - that's why it is written in js.

This bot is currently running on [Replit](https://replit.com/) and using a 3rd party site called [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to keep it online indefinitely.
</br></br>
There are 3 main commands currently on the bot, they are explained in the <kbd>!help</kbd> command:
